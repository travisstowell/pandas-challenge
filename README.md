Homework Repository For Pandas Challenge

In this homework I used the supplied files to create the jupyter notebook called PyCitySchools.ipynb

Observations
The top 5 performing schools wer all charter schools.  Spending per student was between $578-$638.  Converseley the 5 bottom performing schools were district school with just over half the students passing in both Math and Reading.  What's interesting is that spending per student was higer in these school.  This indicates that budget may not be a factor in reading and math performance.  

School size seems to have an impact on overall performance.  Once you get past 2000 students scores for math, reading and overall passing drop significantly
